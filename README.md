## 🧐 Problem Statement <a name = "problem_statement"></a>
In the United States, data has shown show that police kill civilians more than any other country. Minority populations have faced the greatest consequences for this. We look to analyze proportionally how different communities of color are affected.


## 💡 Idea / Solution <a name = "idea"></a>
We created a data analytics dashboard where individuals can view the data from the Washington Post database presented on a d3 map. In addition, we were able to come to multiple conclusions by looking at relationships between the data. The data is accessed through an API so it is updated as the WP database is updated. 


## ⛓️ Dependencies / Limitations <a name = "limitations"></a>
Because of the lack of a federal database of police shootings to the public, we had to use the Washington Post award winning Fatal Encounters database.


## 🚀 Future Scope <a name = "future_scope"></a>
We plan to incorporate and overlay ecnonomic data to see if we can find more relationships between the data. In addition, we hope to see if we can add police reforms in the past to see how they have directly affected the amount of fatal encounters that have occurred.
